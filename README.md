Cybersecurity Projects
Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio! My name is Kenenth, and I am a dedicated cybersecurity student at Western Governors University, pursuing a degree in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance. With a solid foundation in networking, complemented by certifications such as CompTIA Security+, Network+, and A+, and Linux LPI Essentials, I am passionate about applying my skills to real-world challenges in cybersecurity.

This repository showcases hands-on projects and labs that reflect my growing expertise in areas such as vulnerability management, penetration testing, and network security. Highlights include Capture the Flag (CTF) write-ups, virtual lab environments, and Raspberry Pi projects that explore secure configurations and network monitoring.

My goal is to leverage my technical knowledge and problem-solving abilities to secure a challenging role in cybersecurity, where I can protect systems and data while continuously growing in this dynamic field.

Feel free to explore my projects, and don't hesitate to connect with me for collaboration or professional opportunities!
